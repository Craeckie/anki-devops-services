### Configuration files

You may find various files under the `Configuration/` directory:

* Environment variables to source before using the images. Our shell scripts are going to remind you which of these are needed for a particular setup. You may inspect the contents of such a file before sourcing.

* Example configurations of the setup will require you to copy and customize.
